1. Run this app in a local testing server. Once the server is running, take a screenshot of your terminal window and add it to your images folder (screenshots on Mac: shift + command + 4) (screenshots in Windows: search ‘snip’ in the control panel to open the snipping tool)

2. Create a header that matches the header.png image and style it to look the same. You should include the logo (united-nations.png) and nav. It should be 100px tall and live inside the <header> div. Don't forget the hover states (the blue background color).

3. Create a Git repository called "487-final" and add a commit with the message 'Built the nav'

5. Using CSS, make the "mobile-btn" item appear on screens smaller than 767px. Style the navigation for mobile so that it looks like the "header-mobile.png". Note: the nav when expanded should sit exactly below the header.

6. Using JS and jQuery, make the nav toggle up and down when you click on the mobile button.

7. Add a second commit with the message 'Made nav responsive'

8. Create a JS object called 'student.' This student has three properties: her name is Brenda, her age is 20, and she likes coding (boolean)

9. Write a function that logs Brenda’s name and age to the console if she likes coding

10. Make a third commit with the message, ‘Finished the Brenda function’

11. Load the data from refugees.json log the data to your console.

12. Create a callback function called 'buildContent()' and pass the data from refugees to that callback function.

13. Now, loop through the data to build HTML content. Console log the Origin (country name) and the Value (number of refugee requests).

14. Use this looped data to build the HTML content. Each country/request pair should be in a separate div with a class of 'card'. It should look like "cards-unstyled.png"

15. Make a fourth commit with the message, ‘Looped through the JSON data’

16. Style the cards so that they look like the "cards-styled.png image". The country should be on the front of the card, and when you hover, the number of requests should appear. Hint: You might have to refactor the way your data is populating the HTML to achieve this.

14. Make a fifth commit with the message, ‘Styled the cards’

15. Do some final CSS work to make sure the cards are stacked on screens smaller than 767px.

16. Add the Google Font Roboto and make the whole webpage in that font.

17. Make a final commit with the message "Finished the coding test", and make sure all of your code is pushed to Github.

18. Email me the link at lexinamer@gmail.com when you are finished. Good luck with the rest of your exams!
